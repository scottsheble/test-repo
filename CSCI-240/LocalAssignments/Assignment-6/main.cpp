/********************************************************
    CSCI 240        Program 3       Fall 2023

    Programmer: Scott Sheble

    Section: 1

    Date Due: 10/20/23

    Purpose: For this assignment, the focus will be on 
    writing and calling functions. The functions will be 
    used to write a program that completes a series of 
    computation exercises. A menu of different options 
    will be shown to a user at the beginning of the 
    program (and again after each function's objective 
    has been concluded). The user will select an option 
    and the program will then prompt for additional 
    information that is specific to that option. 
    This process will continue until the user decides 
    to quit.
