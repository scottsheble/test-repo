Exam 2 Review Problem 1

A function named calcAverage takes two arguments: a double
that holds a sum, and an integer that holds a count. It
returns a double: the calculated average.

a) What is the function prototype?

b) What is a possible function header?

C) Write a calling statement for the calcAverage function
using the following declarations:

double average, total;
int numValues;
*/


#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip>

using namespace std;
/*A function named calcAverage takes two arguments: a double
