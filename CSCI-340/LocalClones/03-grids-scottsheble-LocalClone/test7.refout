********************************************************************************
* Seventh unit test - make sure this is right before moving on to next
*   This tests your load_from_file method to see if it works as expected.
* Remember that cin's extraction operator, >>, is being used to get the values
* here, so we may see different answers depending on how that converts the string
* in the file into a value of the type contained by your grid.
